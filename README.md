First Capstone Project
Lung Cancer Predictive Model

#The Problem area: 

My area of interest is healthcare, particularly focusing on lung cancer diagnosis and risk prediction. One of the key challenges in healthcare is the early and accurate diagnosis of various diseases, which is essential for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. The opportunity my project could address is developing machine learning solutions that can aid in the early detection and prediction of lung cancer. The project predicts the risk of lung cancer occurrence and the level of risk (high or low) . Therefore , enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment plans. 

#The User: 

The users who experience these problems are healthcare professionals such as doctors and genetic counsellors, patients, radiologists and healthcare systems. Healthcare professionals would benefit from improved risk prediction tools that can assist in making more accurate and early diagnoses and therefore performing further analysis as required. Patients would benefit from early lung cancer detection, leading to better treatment outcomes. Healthcare systems would benefit from reduced costs associated with late-stage disease treatments. 

#The Big Idea: 

Machine learning can bring significant solutions to lung cancer prediction by leveraging its ability to analyze and learn from large datasets, identify patterns, and make predictions.It can assess a person's risk of developing lung cancer by considering various factors, including their medical history (chronic diseases and allergies), genetic profile, and lifestyle choices.Specifically, it can assess the level of risk associated with predominant risk factors like smoking and age. Predictive models can help identify individuals who may benefit from early screening or lifestyle interventions. Overall , different variables can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations, the predictive model can provide assessment of a patient's risk of developing lung cancer and the level of that risk. 

#The Impact: 

The impact of improving disease diagnosis and prediction using machine learning is substantial. Lung cancer typically takes several years to manifest symptoms, and once it does, the progression will be fast and painful.Therefore, early detection can lead to more effective treatments, potentially saving lives and improving the quality of life for patients. Moreover, it can significantly reduce healthcare costs by shifting the focus from late-stage, expensive treatments to cost-effective preventive and early intervention strategies. The scale of the problem is vast, with millions of lives affected, trillions of dollars spent on healthcare worldwide, and significant time and resources allocated to treating advanced diseases. 

#The Data: 

1- The resource for the main dataset:
